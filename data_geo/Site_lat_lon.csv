New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF1,35.6885,-105.82445,at old USGS station (not current big cement flume) just upstream on mainstem of Santa Fe River above McClure reservoir. No longer sampled after 2023. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines.
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF2,35.68833,-105.82362,"at first trib above McClure resevoir entering mainstem on river left, sampled upstream from road. No longer sampled after 2023. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF3,35.70785,-105.80577,"at end of road, just upstream of log crossing mainstem, on mainstem. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF4,35.7211,-105.79825,at small trib on mainstem RR. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines.
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF5,35.72102,-105.7978,at mainstem just upstream of USF4. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines.
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF6,35.73015,-105.79069,"at mainstem upstream from trib that trail crosses. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines. Sampled here in 2023, but a new site was established in 2024 just upstream."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF7,35.73052,-105.7912,"at trib entering mainstem RR, upstream from trib waterfall, downstream from trail. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF8,35.71702,-105.80235,"at barely trickling trib entering mainstem on RR, sampled upstream from trail. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF9,35.74937,-105.7783,at trib that enters mainstem on mainstem RR. Latlon in this spreadsheet adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines. NOTE that the point is NOT adjusted in Gaia because this R-generated streamline is fairly far off from the sampling location and so would be difficult to find in the field if we adjusted it in Gaia.
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF10,35.74887,-105.7771,at mainstem above confluence with USF11 (USF11 is the secondary mainstem/largest trib). Latlon in this spreadsheet adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines. NOTE that the point is NOT adjusted in Gaia because this R-generated streamline is fairly far off from the sampling location and so would be difficult to find in the field if we adjusted it in Gaia.
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF11,35.74505,-105.77615,"at secondary mainstem/largest trib, which enters mainstem on RL. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF12,35.68878,-105.82297,at mainstem upstream from USF2. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines.
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF13,35.7805,-105.77445,"at trib entering mainstem from mainstem RR, draining western upper watershed. Sampled close to mainstem the first time it was sampled, and then sampled more upstream on the trib thereafter because there are several small inflows to ms that may be part of USF13's drainage network. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF14,35.77975,-105.77334,"at mainstem upstream of USF13 (and upstream of the inflows that might be part of USF13), draining East upper watershed. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF15,35.78403,-105.77209,"at ""mainstem"" Santa Fe River (as hydro maps show it), though the closest trib (USF16) is larger. Sampled ABOVE a meadow that is formed by the confluence of USF15 and USF16. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF16,35.78376,-105.77162,"at ""trib"" draining the upper east subcatchment of whole watershed. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF17,35.78192,-105.77138,at trib draining East watershed. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines.
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF18,35.78298,-105.77126,at trib draining East watershed. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines.
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF19,35.7888,-105.77625,below lake where stream emerges from underground. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines.
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF20,35.73099,-105.79001,"At mainstem upstream from where USF7 joins mainstem. USF6 was established in 2023, but this site replaced USF6 in 2024 because it is easier to access. Latlon adjusted on 2024-05-08 to fall on R-generated streamlines."
New Mexico,Sante Fe,USF21,35.77915,-105.77381,at mainstem downstream of USF13 and USF14. Lowest point in the upper watershed!
